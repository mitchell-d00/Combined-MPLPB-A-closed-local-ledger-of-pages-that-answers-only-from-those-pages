# MPLPB system and creator

MPLPB is a closed local ledger of sealed HTML pages. This interface is a front end
to its Python reader and provenance gate. It is not a language model or a game simulation.

Creator: Mitchell D. McPhetridge. Repository account: mitchell-d00.
The current user identifies themself as the project's creator. This is a creator
attribution declaration; this system cannot authenticate a person's identity.
The assistant helped implement these changes. That does not make it the creator.

Repository: https://github.com/mitchell-d00/Combined-MPLPB-A-closed-local-ledger-of-pages-that-answers-only-from-those-pages
Interface inspiration: Mitchell's Give It Back: The RPG.

Reader: majority declared-word ownership, with the complete-name ambiguity guard
and subset specificity, followed by every-word prose containment when no scope owns
the question. One owner returns its page; several stop; none refuse.
This is lexical retrieval. It does not provide semantic search or general paraphrase understanding.

Gate: separate eligible sources with sealed hashes and provenance declarations.
A word on one page and another word on a second page do not prove a relationship.
Source pins prove recorded bytes, not truth or authenticated authorship.

Chat: explicit topic selection, it/its follow-ups, exact source text, and bounded
inference over literal structured Fact lines. It labels source assertions and rule
inferences separately. Unsupported relations are unknown, not false.
Commands: search TOPIC; import Exact Wikipedia title; topic Exact local title;
relate SUBJECT -> OBJECT. Natural questions still pass through the lexical reader.
There is no language model, hidden semantic reasoning, or autonomous web browsing.

Topic import: explicit Wikipedia search and title selection, raw revision responses,
main-slot SHA-1, wikitext SHA-256, deterministic local lead rendering and immutable
captures. Older observations remain in the tree. A same-revision byte conflict is
archived and blocks the imported-topic collection. Imports do not create an evaluation score.

UI: corpus tiles, source dialogs, revision history, deterministic chat, a tab journal,
and Fantasy/Sci-fi/Wasteland visual settings. Python must be running locally.
Opening index.html alone displays launcher instructions. GitHub Pages cannot run
the local Python reader.

Chat sessions remain in server memory, with a maximum of 100 turns per session.
They disappear when the server stops or a session is cleared/evicted. Export explicitly
to save a transcript with turn hashes, source pins and rule identifiers.
Imported public source captures are stored locally. Browser preferences contain
visual setting, theme, selected corpus and profile, not saved questions or source bodies.

This document describes implemented capabilities, not an accuracy guarantee.
The project still has lexical misses. No new live Wikipedia evaluation score is
claimed merely because the interface searches, imports, displays or chats about pages.
